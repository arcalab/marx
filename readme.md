# MARx

MARx is a reactive programming language for synchronous connectors, based on Arx experimental language (presented in Coordination'20 - [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-50029-0_3), [slides](http://arca.di.uminho.pt/content/arx-slides-20.pdf), [git](https://github.com/arcalab/arx)).

This language aims at specifying networks of automata with specific constructs for composing the automata, inspired in the Reo coordination language.
