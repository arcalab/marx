Using the tools
===============

While the toolset is developed in Scala, the code is compiled into **JavaScript** using
`ScalaJS <https://wwws.scala- js.org>`_ to produce an interactive web page.

Widgets
^^^^^^^

The toolset is organized in a set of widgets, each of them providing some functionality:
edition, visualization, or analysis.

By clicking in a widgets' name it is possible to `open` or `close` such a widget.
By default only some widgets are open.

All widgets, except the `Examples` widget use the program specified in the `ARx program`
to carried on with their functionality.

Below we explain each widget in detail.
